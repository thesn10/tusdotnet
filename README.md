>"Our aim is to solve the problem of unreliable file uploads once and for all. tus is a new open protocol for resumable uploads built on HTTP. It offers simple, cheap and reusable stacks for clients and servers. It supports any language, any platform and any network." - https://tus.io

tusdotnet is a .NET server implementation of the tus.io protocol that runs on both .NET 4.x and .NET Core!

Comments, ideas, questions and PRs are welcome :)

## Features

* Runs on OWIN and ASP.NET Core (on both .NET Framework and .NET Core)
* Full support for tus 1.0.0 including all major extensions (checksum, concatenation, creation, upload-defer-length, expiration and termination)
* Fast and reliable
* Easy to configure
* Customizable data storage
* MIT licensed

## Install

Visual Studio

``PM> Install-Package tusdotnet``

.NET CLI

``> dotnet add tusdotnet``

## Configure

Create your Startup class as you would normally do. Add a using statement for `tusdotnet` and run `UseTus` on the app builder. More options and events are available on the [wiki](https://github.com/tusdotnet/tusdotnet/wiki/Configuration).

```csharp
app.UseTus(httpContext => new DefaultTusConfiguration
{
    // c:\tusfiles is where to store files
    Store = new TusDiskStore(@"C:\tusfiles\"),
    // On what url should we listen for uploads?
    UrlPath = "/files",
    Events = new Events
    {
        OnFileCompleteAsync = async eventContext =>
        {
            ITusFile file = await eventContext.GetFileAsync();
            await DoSomeProcessing(file);
        }
    }
});

```

## Test sites

If you just want to play around with tusdotnet/the tus protocol, clone the repo and run one of the test sites. They each launch a small site running tusdotnet and the [official JS client](https://github.com/tus/tus-js-client) so that you can test the protocol on your own machine. 

Test sites are available for:

* ASP.NET Core 3.1 (.NET Core 3.1)
* ASP.NET Core 3.0 (.NET Core 3.0)
* ASP.NET Core 2.2 (.NET Core 2.2)
* ASP.NET Core 2.2 (.NET Framework 4.6.2)
* ASP.NET Core 2.1 (.NET Core 2.1)
* OWIN (.NET Framework 4.5.2)

## Clients

[Tus.io](http://tus.io/implementations.html) keeps a list of clients for a number of different platforms (Android, Java, JS, iOS etc). tusdotnet should work with all of them as long as they support version 1.0.0 of the protocol.
